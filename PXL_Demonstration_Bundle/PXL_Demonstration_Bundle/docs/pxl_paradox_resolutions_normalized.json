But 𝕀₁(C) = 𝕀₁(C → P) creates reflexive dependency. Modal priority violated: (𝕀₁(C) → 𝕀₁(C → P)) → 𝕀₁(C). This is circular grounding: 𝕀₁(C) ⊗ (C → 𝕀₁(C)) = ⊥.

PXL Resolution: R ≡ 'entity E such that □(created_by(E, B) ∧ ¬liftable_by(E, B))'. This requires: B creates E that logically constrains B's power, i.e., B ⟼ ¬(B ⟼ lift(E)).
